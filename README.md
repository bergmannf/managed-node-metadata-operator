Directional metadata sync operator from MachineSets to existing Nodes

## General Overview

Adding node labels and taints to non-default MachinePools is allowed through OCM; however, due to [intentional limitations](https://github.com/openshift/machine-api-operator/blob/master/FAQ.md#adding-annotations-and-labels-to-nodes-via-machines) in OpenShift’s [machine-api-operator](https://github.com/openshift/machine-api-operator), labels and taints are not reconciled to existing machines within a machine set. Today you must scale down the MachinePool to 0 and back up again to update nodes. This is obviously undesirable and doesn’t present a good user experience for customers.

Managed OpenShift does not allow customers to label nodes directly.

This managed-node-metadata-operator will attempt to watch MachineSet objects and reconcile any labels or taints that are added to the corresponding Nodes within the pool.

      end
    end
```

## Development and Testing
Refer to the [development and testing guide](docs/development-and-testing.md) to understand how to run and test the operator.

## Boilerplate
This repository subscribes to the [openshift/golang-osd-operator](https://github.com/openshift/boilerplate/tree/master/boilerplate/openshift/golang-osd-operator) convention of [boilerplate](https://github.com/openshift/boilerplate/).
See the [README](boilerplate/openshift/golang-osd-operator/README.md) for details about the functionality that brings in.

## Running Tests Locally

Note that the tests expect that three environment variables are set for the tests to be able to run.  The suite will quickly fail if these are unset:

- `OCM_TOKEN`
- `OCM_CLUSTER_ID`
- `OCM_ENV`

Here is an example of running the tests in a local environment:

```bash
$ cd <PROJECT_ROOT>/test/e2e/
$ export OCM_TOKEN=$(ocm token)
$ export OCM_CLUSTER_ID=<YOUR-CLUSTER-ID>
$ export OCM_ENV=<stage|int>
$ DISABLE_JUNIT_REPORT=true ginkgo run --tags=osde2e,e2e --procs 4 --flake-attempts 3 --trace -vv .
